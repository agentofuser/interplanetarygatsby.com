Hi, thanks for checking out this page.

As you can see down at the bottom, both the software and the content on
Interplanetary Gatsby are published under the most permissive licenses
possible. Essentially in the public domain.

I do this because I want the Distributed Web to succeed, and I think bridging
the worlds of IPFS and Gatsby (and file-based websites and apps in general) is
a great way to drive the adoption of IPFS and decentralization-enabling
technologies.

You know how this goes: the greater the financial support that is available for
this project, the more time and resources I can dedicate to it and the wider
are the reach and impact it can have.

So here is the ask: please install the
[Brave](https://brave.com 'Brave browser') browser (which is good for you
regardless), and
[add a monthly tip](https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021123971-How-do-I-tip-websites-and-Content-Creators-in-Brave-Rewards- 'pretty please')
to Interplanetary Gatsby in the Brave Rewards screen. That way you will help me
help you and the (intergalactic!) internet.

Let's do it. For the user!
